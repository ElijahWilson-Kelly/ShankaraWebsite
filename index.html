		<p>Brendan and Elijah, AKA Shankara NZ, have been making music with a passion for over a decade, experimenting with sonic creations since they first met in high school. Influenced by all things DUB, especially early dubstep, and nourished by their native environment, they produce a uniquely melodic and organic style of bass music.
Their sonic experience is constantly on the move, regularly taking in new sounds and ideas, and with releases on Shanti Planti, Dubmission, Desert Trax, Street Ritual and Adapted Records, Shankara NZ are making waves at home and abroad.
Shankara NZ's dynamic live show, either as a duo with synths, guitar and flute or just Brendan performing solo, features a sound shower of dub delay, rolling basslines, ethereal melodies and tribal energy.
