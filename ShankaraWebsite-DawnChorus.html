  <p>Shankara NZ make their Dubmission debut with “Dawn Chorus”, a five track EP inspired by the sights, sounds and vibes of their surroundings on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand.
  <br><br>
  While they may be better known for their involvement, along with the likes of Desert Dwellers and Grouch, in the downtemple scene, dub is, and always has been, the glue that binds Brendan and Elijah together: the back and forth of the skank and the deep rhymes of the basslines are the underlying backdrop of their musical minds.
  <br><br>
  “Dawn Chorus” begins with the hypnotic bassline and plucked guitar of “43.6 South”, which is followed by “Tui”, featuring the lyrical stylings of esp Mc. “Weka” is charged by a righteous horn section, synthesised dub lasers and a heavy step, leading smoothly into the dub daydream of “In Ya Mind”, again featuring the liquid vocals of esp Mc. Finally comes “No Worries”, a relaxing reggae-ish welcome to the sun.
  <br><br>
  The five tracks were recorded spontaneously in the Shankara NZ studio, with all except “In Ya Mind” featuring the basslines of the legendary bass machine Finn Kelcher. If you listen closely, you can hear the sounds of Tuis, Bellbirds and other native New Zealand birds in the background, underlying the tunes, representing the natural world that inspires and nurtures the duo.
